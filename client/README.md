# Job Posting Board - Frontend (Client)

This is the frontend of the Job Posting Board application, built with **React** (or **Next.js**, depending on your stack). It allows recruiters to register, post jobs, and manage their listings. Candidates can view job posts and receive updates via email automation. The frontend interacts with the backend APIs and provides a user-friendly interface.

## Introduction

The Job Posting Board frontend is designed to allow users (recruiters and candidates) to interact seamlessly with the backend. Recruiters can log in via OTP (email or mobile) to post jobs, while candidates can view and filter job listings. This part of the project handles the user interface (UI) and communicates with the backend API.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the frontend (client) up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Job Posting Board Repository**:
   First, clone the main repository that contains both frontend and backend code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JobPost.git
