# Job Posting Board - Frontend (Client)

This is the frontend of the Job Posting Board application, built with **React** (or **Next.js**, depending on your stack). It allows recruiters to register, post jobs, and manage their listings. Candidates can view job posts and receive updates via email automation. The frontend interacts with the backend APIs and provides a user-friendly interface.
